# Notes

## Get
Using get would mean that anyone between you and the server can see the URL - this wouldnt matter for a sight like amazon but for more private data it can be a major issue

## Post
Using post would basically encrypt the data so that no one between the user and the server cab read the URL - This would be mainly used for private data.

## CSRF token
This stops any applicatiojn from using the application.. This is needed for security. Dont need to worry about it just make sure its included.

## Dictionary loike object 
not actually a dictionary but acts like one - common django phrase
