# What is django
Python based web framework
Django is modular.

# Main Building blocks of django

## Template
The template system is when you inject text which therefore outputs a result. The type of text transformation can be relatively complex however the basic concept is text in text out

## ORM - Object Relational Mapper
What this does is basically uses a python class that we provide and changes this into an SQL table. This allows the user to manipulate a python class so that they dont have to use SQL directly.
Python class >>> SQL Table

## Rooting
This takes in a URL and activates a python function. 

URL >>> Pythan callable

## Views
This will alwasy take a request and then also always spit out a response/exception. Basically this means that a request will go in and a response/exception goes out. 

Request >>> Response/Exception
